## Jack of all trades, master of **`Some(T)`***



Greetings! 

I'm Jakob Kilo and this is my personal website [k94.ch](/)


The main content on this site can be found in [my blog](./blog/index.md) 
where I want to cover topics ranging from Rust crates, 
cryptography and strength training, to travel and other curiosities.


If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [contact me.](./contact.md)
