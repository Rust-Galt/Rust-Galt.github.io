## Jack of all trades, master of **`Some(wip)`** [^wip]



Greetings! 

I'm Jakob Kilo and this is [k94.ch](/), my personal website. 


The main content on this site can be found in [my blog](./blog/README.md) 
where I want to cover topics ranging from Rust crates, 
cryptography and strength training, to travel and other curiosities.


If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [contact me.](./contact.md)
